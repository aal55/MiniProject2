    <h2>Getting Started With GitHub</h2>
    <p>First sign into GitHub and create a new repository. Then give your repository a name (and a README and gitignore
      if you want). Finally, make your repository.</p>
    <h2>Forking vs. Cloning</h2>
    <p>Forking is a feature on GitHub that allows a user to take a copy of someone else's repository and use it for
      their own personal use with the ability to make pull requests. Cloning is a Git concept extremely similar to
      forking, with the main difference being that cloning allows a person to make an unconnected copy of a repository
      to place in a directory of their choosing.</p>
    <h2>Branches</h2>
    <p>Branches allow users to work on separate tasks in a project. For every Git repository, there is a master branch,
      which functions as the source branch where changes are finalized. From then on, a user can create their own branch
      (essentially a copy of the master branch) where they can work on their designated assignments separate from
      everyone else contributing to the repository. By giving everyone their own separate workspace instead of piling
      everything in the master branch, branching helps ensure that multiple contributors don't interfere with each
      other's work.</p>
    <h2>Pull Request</h2>
    <p>When a user's work on their branch is ready to be added to the master branch, it's time for a pull request. A
      pull request allows a branch to be submitted to the repository owner to see if it can be successfully merged with
      the master branch. However, when there are major difference in two branches that are set to be merged, a merge
      conflict is created, barring the merge from happening until the owner settles the conflicts. By choosing to
      resolve the conflicts within GitHub, the owner can adjust the areas where merge conflicts occur to make sure that
      the merge can be pulled off. After resolving the merge conflicts, the merge can successfully take place and
      everyone can go about their own business.</p>
    <h2>Adding a Collaborator</h2>
    <p>First, go settings on your GitHub repository. Then go to the 'Collaborators' Tab and add a collaborator. Finally,
      enter your password and the person's username/email.</p>
